    "**1.1.1 [5 points]**  Read in the dataset `flights.csv`. Create a variable `DELAY_OR_NOT` that denotes whether `ARRIVAL_DELAY` is greater than or equal to 15 minutes (the FAA and BTS define a flight as delayed only if it arrives 15 minutes late or more). This is going to be the response variable for the rest of this question. \n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "**1.1.2 [5 points]** Preprocess the data: one-hot-encode the non-numeric categorical variables, deal with missing values if there are any, scale your data, and split the data into training and test sets (use an 80/20 split with `random_state=111`). Print the resulting shapes of your $X$ and $y$ dataframes for both your train and your test sets.\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "**1.2 [5 points]** Fit an artificial neural network model using all predictors (name this model `NN_model`).  Use a dense feed-forward network with two hidden layers with 15 nodes in each hidden layer. For this network, use appropriate activation functions for each layer, select an appropriate loss function and optimizer, specify a validation split of 0.2, train for an appropriate number of epochs based on the results of your training and validation accuracy plot, and feel free to use the default batch size while training. Plot the training accuracy and validation accuracy as a function of epochs from your `NN_model` training history. Evaluate the `NN_model` model on both train and test, and print out the resulting train and test accuracies.\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "**1.3 [10 points]** To begin our interpretation of the resulting `NN_model`, we will first use a \"proxy model\" that we know how to interpret and train it on our `NN_model` training predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "- **1.3.1** For this we need to modify our training set. First, generate a set of `NN_model` class predictions for the training set. These training predictions will be used to form a revised training dataset for our proxy model: (a) use all of the same $X$ values used by `NN_model` for our $X$ train and (b) replace the actual response values $y$ with the predicted $\\hat{y}$ values generated by the fitted `NN_model`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "- **1.3.2** Next, fit a logistic regression model using your revised training dataset from 1.3.1 (name this model `logreg`). Use ridge-like regularization. Print the `logreg` test accuracy to confirm that it is similar to what we saw for our `NN_model` test accuracy in 1.2. You may need to adjust `C` in order to achieve a similar accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "- **1.3.3** Now use sklearn's `permutation_importance` class (already included in this notebook's imports) to compute the feature importance using the `logreg` model.\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "  - Read the official documentation for `permutation_importance` [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/permutation_importance.html#:~:text=The%20permutation%20feature%20importance%20is,model%20depends%20on%20the%20feature.) as well as [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance.html#sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance) to learn how it works.\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "  - You can use the default number of `n_repeats` and your estimator's default `scorer`. To speed up the time it takes to run your permutations, you can try setting `n_jobs=-1` to take full advantage of all of your available processor cores.\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "  - Measure the **relative** variable importance (i.e. as a proportion of the variable importance of the most important variable identified by `permutation_importance`) and generate a barplot illustrating the relative variable importances for the top-10 most important predictors identified using `permutation_importance`.\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.4 [10 points]** Another way to interpret the  `NN_model` is by examining the response as a function of any of the predictors. Particularly, we will select from features often found most significant from the analysis above. **For all 1.4 plots below**, for ease of interpretation, **please be certain to** display all predictors on their original scales. \n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **1.4.1** Set all predictors to their means/modes except for `SCHED_DEP_HOUR`. Predict the probability of delay and plot the predicted probabilities of delay vs. `SCHED_DEP_HOUR` on the data from the **training set**. Interpret what you see in 2-4 sentences.\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    " \n",
    "   - **1.4.2** Set all predictors to their means/modes except for `SCHED_DEP_HOUR` and `FLIGHT_COUNT`. Predict the probability of delay and plot the predicted probabilities of delay vs. `SCHED_DEP_HOUR` and `FLIGHT_COUNT` from the training set (see the question 1.4 \"HINT\" below).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "   - **1.4.3**   Set all predictors to their means/modes except for except for `SCHED_DEP_HOUR` and `SCHED_ARR_HOUR`. Predict the probability of delay and plot the predicted probabilities of delay vs. `SCHED_DEP_HOUR` and `SCHED_ARR_HOUR` from the training set.\n",

    "<br /><br />\n",
    "   - **1.4.4** Set all predictors to their means/modes except for except for `SCHED_DEP_HOUR` and `DISTANCE`. Predict the probability of delay and plot the predicted probabilities of delay vs. `SCHED_DEP_HOUR` and `DISTANCE` from the training set. \n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **1.4.5** In 5-10 sentences, interpret what you have seen in 1.4.2, 1.4.3, and 1.4.4.\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "**HINT:** For 1.4.2, 1.4.3, and 1.4.4, when you include `SCHED_DEP_HOUR` on one axis and your second predictor on the other axis, you can color your datapoints based on their corresponding predicted probabilities by using  the `c` and `cmap` arguments in `plt.scatter`. You can also add a labeled colorbar to your plot to make clear what those colors mean. Please refer to the matplotlib documentation for examples.\n",

    "    \n",
    "**1.5 [5 points]**\n",
    "    \n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "In this part, we will attempt to do model inference. Neural Networks have too many parameters, and therefore inference on all the parameters is intractable and meaningless. \n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "Using the same network architecture as `NN_model` (layers, nodes, activations, etc.) and your scaled data from that model, create multiple training sets using bootstrapping and fit a separate neural network model to each bootstrapped set of data (a minimum of at least 50 bootstraps should be used). Predict the output on the test data for each model. Randomly select 8 test observations and on 8 subplots, plot the distribution of predicted probabilities (i.e. $n$ bootstrapped probabilites) with the 95% CI bounds clearly marked and reported in each subplot and the actual class of each observation included in each subplot's title for easy reference.\n",
    "    <br /><br />\n",
    "Interpret what you see in 3-5 sentences.\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "    \n",
    "**NOTE:** The code for this problem can take an extremely long time to execute. Please feel free to use the provided `progressbar` function below to visually track the progress of your bootstraps.\n",

    "**1.6 [10 points]**\n",
    "    \n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "Using the probability distribution of the predictions obtained from the bootstrapped samples above, we can evaluate how \"significant\" our bagged (i.e. bootstrap-aggregated) prediction will be for each test observation.\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "To accomplish this, you will first calculate the ratio of bootstrapped probabilities that cross the threshold value of $\\hat{p}=0.5$. Let's call this ratio the **Posterior Prediction Ratio (PPR)**. When a bagged prediction's $PPR=0$, all predictions are compatible (i.e. all bootstrapped probabilities for that test observation are on the same side of $\\hat{p}=0.5$). Likewise, when the $PPR=0.5$, half of the bootstrapped predictions for that test observation are $\\hat{y}=0$, and the other half are $\\hat{y}=1$. After calculating your $PPR$ values for all test observations, you should have $n=2000$ $PPR$ values (i.e. one for each test observation).\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "Next, to get more accurate predictions, we can create an **abstain** model that will abstain from making a prediction for a particular observation if some defined threshold for significance (i.e. maximum $PPR$ value) is not met. (If you'd like to learn more about abstain models, you can read more [here](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxF73R9tX).)\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "Let's explore how your resulting test accuracies might change by using your bootstrapped prediction results from question 1.5 for an **abstain bagging model** (i.e. a bootstrap aggregated model where some test observations are simply not predicted based on a given $PPR$ threshold). You can make your abstain model *stricter* by using smaller $PPR$ threshold values.\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "- Print the test accuracy for your **bagging model** predictions from question 1.5 using predictions for all 2,000 of our test observations. \n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "- Plot the test accuracies for an **abstain bagging model** using your predictions from question 1.5 as a function of increasing $PPR$.\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "- Also, plot the proportion of test observations not abstained (i.e. the proportion of those predicted) for your **abstain bagging model** as a function of increasing $PPR$.\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "- Interpret what you see in 3-5 sentences.\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "    \n",
    "**NOTE**: You should observe that as $PPR$ decreases (more confident predictions), you must also compromise on the number of points that your abstain model predicts confidently. \n",

    "ANNs can be prone to overfitting, where they learn specific patterns present in the training data, but the patterns do not generalize to new data.\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "There are several methods used to improve ANN generalization. \n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "One approach is to use an architecture just barely wide or deep enough to fit the data. The idea here is that smaller networks are less expressive and thus less able to overfit the data.\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "However, it is difficult to know a priori the correct size of the ANN, and it is computationally costly to hunt for the correct size. Given this, other methodologies are used to prevent overfitting and improve ANNs' generalizability. These methodologies, like other techniques that combat overfitting, fall under the umbrella term of \"regularization\".\n",
